CURRENTLY CONFIGURING LIBRARY

Current Functionality:

- local-DIC for planar displacements (lucas-kanade)
- stereo-DIC for depth estimation
- strain computation

Refactoing in progress:

- global-DIC for planar displacements (FE-based)
- camera calibration (3D object)
- documentation
- unit tests
