CURRENTLY CONFIGURING LIBRARY

Current Functionality:

- local-DIC for planar displacements (lucas-kanade)
- stereo-DIC for depth estimation
- strain computation
- global DIC
- implicit calibration (3D object, no distortion correction)

Refactoring in progress:

- global-DIC for planar displacements (FE-based)
- documentation
- unit tests
