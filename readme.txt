CURRENTLY CONFIGURING LIBRARY

Current Functionality:

- local-DIC for planar displacements (lucas-kanade)
- stereo-DIC for depth estimation
- strain computation
- global DIC (global folder)
- implicit calibration (3D object, no distortion correction) (calibration folder)

Refactoring in progress:

- documentation
- unit tests

Download all files in workspace to run strain study example
