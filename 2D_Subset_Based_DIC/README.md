# run-dic
Open-source DIC software in Python

The main.ipynb notebook is currently setup to run DIC between two images.
Please load the two images in the folder named 'images' in your current working directory.
Use the naming convention 'img0', 'img1' to ensure they are read in the correct order, or change the source code in the LoadImages() function.
